## Introduction

The MapHub API allows you to programmatically interact with your maps and data. With the API, you can:

- Upload and download maps
- Manage folders and workspaces
- Query map metadata and statistics
- Access tiled map data
- Automate workflows

<Highlight>
  <strong>Key Benefits:</strong> The MapHub API enables seamless integration
  with your existing tools and workflows, allowing you to automate processes and
  build custom applications on top of MapHub's infrastructure.
</Highlight>

Whether you're building a custom application, integrating MapHub into your existing tools, or automating repetitive tasks, the API provides a powerful interface to MapHub's functionality.

## API Documentation

The MapHub API is fully documented using OpenAPI (Swagger) specification. You can explore the interactive API documentation at:

- Standard UI: [/docs](https://api-main-432878571563.europe-west4.run.app/docs)

The documentation provides detailed information about each endpoint, including:

- Required parameters
- Request and response formats
- Authentication requirements
- Example requests and responses

## Python API Wrapper

For Python developers, we offer a Python API wrapper that simplifies interaction with the MapHub API.

<Highlight>
  <strong>Important:</strong> The Python API wrapper is currently in an early
  state of development and only supports a limited number of endpoints. We're
  actively working on expanding its capabilities.
</Highlight>

To install the python library simply run: `pip install maphub`

```python
# Example of using the Python API wrapper
from maphub import MapHubClient

# Create the authorized client
client = MapHubClient(api_key="your-api-key")

# Create an example project
example_project = client.create_project("Example Project")

# Upload some GIS data to MapHub
client.upload_map(
    map_name="Example Map",
    project_id=example_project['id'],
    public=False,
    path="path/to/GIS/data.gpkg"
)
```

We're actively working on expanding the wrapper's capabilities. Check our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maphub-co/maphub-python) for the latest updates and documentation.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The MapHub CLI provides a command-line interface for interacting with the MapHub API. It allows you to authenticate with an API key and upload maps to your folders.

<Highlight>
  <strong>Installation:</strong> The CLI is included in the Python package.
  Install it with: `pip install maphub`
</Highlight>

### Authentication

Before using the CLI, you need to authenticate with your MapHub API key:

```sh
maphub auth YOUR_API_KEY
```

This will save your API key to `~/.maphub/config.json` for future use.

### Uploading Maps

To upload a GIS file to your root folder:

```sh
maphub upload path/to/your/file.gpkg
```

To upload a GIS file to a specific folder:

```sh
maphub upload path/to/your/file.gpkg --folder-id YOUR_FOLDER_ID
```

If you don't specify a folder ID, the map will be uploaded to your root folder.

To upload a GIS file with a custom map name:

```sh
maphub upload path/to/your/file.gpkg --map-name "My Custom Map Name"
```

If you don't specify a map name, it will be extracted from the file name (without extension).

## Authentication

The MapHub API uses an **API Key** as authentication method.

You can generate and manage API keys in your [account section](/settings/api-keys).

## Common Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for the MapHub API:

### Automated Map Processing

Set up automated workflows to process and update maps on a schedule:

1. Download the latest data from your source
2. Process and transform the data
3. Upload the updated map to MapHub

### Custom Applications

Build custom applications that leverage MapHub's infrastructure:

1. Use the API to manage maps and folders
2. Embed maps in your application using our embedding features
3. Implement custom visualization and analysis tools

### Data Integration

Integrate MapHub with your existing data systems:

1. Sync data between your database and MapHub
2. Trigger map updates when your data changes
3. Pull map metadata into your reporting systems

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues when using the MapHub API, try these common solutions:

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th className="border px-4 py-2 text-left">Issue</th>
      <th className="border px-4 py-2 text-left">Possible Solution</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td className="border px-4 py-2">Authentication failures</td>
      <td className="border px-4 py-2">
        Verify your API key is valid and has not expired
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border px-4 py-2">Unexpected response format</td>
      <td className="border px-4 py-2">
        Check the API documentation for the expected request and response
        formats
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border px-4 py-2">Timeout errors</td>
      <td className="border px-4 py-2">
        For large file uploads or downloads, increase your client timeout
        settings
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td className="border px-4 py-2">Python wrapper errors</td>
      <td className="border px-4 py-2">
        Ensure you're using the latest version of the wrapper and check the
        GitHub repository for known issues
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
